# Stroke Prediction
A predictive model for stroke diagnosis using logistic regression and upsampling(SMOTE)

### Data
- Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset
- Topic: 11 clinical features for predicting stroke events
- Observations: 5,110 observations
- Variables: 12 variables (id, gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, and stroke)
- Variable Types: Categorical variables (e.g., gender), Binary variable (e.g., ever_married), and numeric variables (e.g., age)
- Null Values: Some missing values exist due to patientsâ€™ unwillingness to provide their personal data and such missing values need to be handled before EDA.

### Objective
- This project targets the identification of key stroke-contributing factors and the development of a predictive model. 
= The ultimate objective is to create an application that enables at-risk individuals to proactively manage their health, thereby preventing stroke-related complications.

### Methodology
- Data Handling
- Explanatory Data Analysis
- Feature Engineering
- Modeling
- Evaluation
- Upsampling
- Deployment with UI/UX Mockups
